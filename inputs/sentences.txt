 
“I had a delightful stay at The Royal Hotel. The location in Russell Square is fantastic, with easy access to major attractions. The British Museum is just a short walk away. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it!” 

“The Royal Hotel offers standard rooms that are great value for money. They provide clean and comfortable accommodation, but don’t expect luxury. It’s a practical choice for budget travelers who want a central location.” 

“Embora a localização seja conveniente, o hotel carece de algumas comodidades modernas. A decoração parece datada e os quartos poderiam ser atualizados. Além disso, o buffet de café da manhã, embora decente, não se destaca.”

“The Royal National Hotel’s proximity to Russell Square and excellent transport links make it an ideal base for exploring London. The newly decorated rooms are clean and relaxing. The buffet breakfast is a great way to start the day!” 

“O London Pub no The Royal National Hotel, embora temporariamente fechado para reforma, costumava servir peixes e salgadinhos. É uma pena que não esteja disponível no momento, mas esperamos que reabra em breve!”
